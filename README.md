## Project Details

Our project is an intelligent chatbot assistant that simplifies access to critical data for a Martian colony. It allows users to consult complex information such as weather, temperature, and resource management in a clear and understandable way, making difficult-to-interpret data accessible even to non-experts. In addition, thanks to its dynamic architecture, it can easily integrate new tools into the AI agent‚Äîsomething crucial in a completely new environment like Mars, where new technologies will continuously emerge.

The backend is developed in Python using Flask and leverages Hugging Face models for natural language processing. We used relatively lightweight models due to limited resources during the hackathon, but tests run with more powerful models produced significantly better results. The goal, with NASA‚Äôs resources, would be to train a specialized model tailored for this specific task.

The system is based on a modular design with a set of functions that process different types of data. One ML model determines which functions are relevant according to the user‚Äôs query, and another interprets the results together with the user‚Äôs request to generate clear and actionable responses. This modular design allows new functions to be easily added as new challenges or data arise.
In other words, the system consists of two main modules: the first selects the most optimal tools from a set of available ones, and the second uses them to provide accurate yet simple responses to the user.

The idea is that the functions accessible to the model perform the complex calculations themselves‚Äîsuch as measuring temperature through sensors, retrieving current resource levels from the database, analyzing local radiation, or predicting upcoming sandstorms. The possibilities are virtually limitless.

The crucial part is that, since we know ML models are probabilistic and not well-suited for performing precise calculations, they act only as interpreters. The functions from the system‚Äôs catalog handle the complex computations, while the ML model simply ‚Äútranslates‚Äù them into a more understandable form for the user. Therefore, the model does not require extremely exhaustive or specialized training‚Äîit only needs to understand human language well and explain results clearly, allowing it to generalize to new functions without needing retraining.

The frontend is a web application built with React that integrates an interactive chatbot. It enables users to communicate with the assistant, explore its functionalities, and receive responses generated by the backend ML models in an intuitive and user-friendly manner.

Overall, the project provides a simple and efficient interface to manage complex information in remote environments like Mars. Its modular, ML-based architecture ensures adaptability, ease of updates, and accessibility for non-expert users, facilitating daily operations and decision-making under extreme conditions.

This would be extremely valuable when the time comes to establish the first colonies on Mars with non-expert personnel, as it would greatly simplify management tasks and reduce the level of specialized knowledge required to participate in such missions.
